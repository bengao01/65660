## Construct two 32-bit integer values.  Do not change this code.
a = z3.BitVec('a', 32)
b = z3.BitVec('b', 32)

## Compute the average of a and b.  The initial computation we provided
## naively adds them and divides by two, but that is not correct.  Modify
## these lines to implement your solution for both unsigned (u_avg) and
## signed (s_avg) division.
##
## Watch out for the difference between signed and unsigned integer
## operations.  For example, the Z3 expression (x/2) performs signed
## division, meaning it treats the 32-bit value as a signed integer.
## Similarly, (x>>16) shifts x by 16 bits to the right, treating it
## as a signed integer.
##
## Use z3.UDiv(x, y) for unsigned division of x by y.
## Use z3.LShR(x, y) for unsigned (logical) right shift of x by y bits.

# Referenced section 2-5 of Hacker's Delight for the formulas used
u_avg = (a & b) + (z3.LShR(a ^ b, 1))
s_avg = (a & b) + ((a ^ b) >> 1)
s_avg = s_avg + ((z3.LShR(s_avg, 31)) & (a ^ b))

## Do not change the code below.

## To compute the reference answers, we extend both a and b by one
## more bit (to 33 bits), add them, divide by two, and shrink back
## down to 32 bits.  You are not allowed to "cheat" in this way in
## your answer.
